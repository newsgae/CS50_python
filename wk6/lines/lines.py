'''
implement a program called lines.py to
    take one command-line argument and
    return its number of lines

specifically:
    count its number of lines of code (LOC) and
    exclude blank lines and comments, assume that
        any line that starts with # is a comment
        # can optionally preceded by whitespace, such as '   # xxx'
        any line that only contains whitespace is blank
        a docstring is not a comment line

    output is the number of lines of code in that file

expects exactly one command-line argument looks like
        $ python lines.py hello.py
        otherwise, program should instead exit via sys.exit
            if the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument
            if the specified fileâ€™s name does not end in .py
            if the specified file does not exist, use FileNotFoundError
